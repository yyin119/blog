# Topics to learn (draft)

The list below contains topics I'd like to dive deeper into. Sub-topics are arranged in order of "fundamental-ness" (earlier topics are more fundamental than later ones).

This is just a rough draft that I'm publishing for future reference. I may throw it away at some point...

**Fundamental CS**
1. Computer architecture (hardware)
2. Math
3. Programming
4. Algo and DS
5. Operating systems
6. Databases
7. Networking
8. Distributed systems
9. Languages and compilers

**LLM internals**
1. Fundamental machine learning
2. LLMs - architecture + how training and inference works
3. Infrastructure for LLMs - GPUs and MLOps
4. Building with LLMs (context engineering, RAG, agents etc)

**Cybersecurity**
1. Red teaming and offensive security
2. AppSec (secure coding, SAST/DAST, threat modelling, API security, supply chain)
3. Infra security (cloud, on-prem (mainly network))
4. Security operations (monitoring, detection engineering, incident response)
5. DFIR
6. Threat intel (malware analysis, adversary tracking etc)

**How to prioritise?**

Not that much time, so focus on interesting + useful things (i.e. what would help in my job + knowledge I can apply frequently).
